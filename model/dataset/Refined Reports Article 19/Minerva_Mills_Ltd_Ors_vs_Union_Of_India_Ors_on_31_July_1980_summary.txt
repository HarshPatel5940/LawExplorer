Case Citation: Minerva Mills Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors, Supreme Court of India, July 31, 1980, Case No. Writ Petition (Civil) No. 356 of 1977

Legal proposition: The case involved a challenge to the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the Sick Textile Undertakings (Nationalisation) Act, 1974, as well as the Constitution (Thirty-Ninth Amendment) Act, which inserted the Nationalisation Act into the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution.

Case History: The case was brought before the Supreme Court of India after a challenge was made to the constitutional validity of the Sick Textile Undertakings (Nationalisation) Act, 1974, and the Constitution (Thirty-Ninth Amendment) Act. The case was initially heard by a division bench of the Supreme Court, which referred it to a larger bench of 13 judges.

Legal Issues/Questions Presented:
1. Whether sections 4 and 55 of the Constitution (Forty Second Amendment) Act were beyond the amending power of the Parliament under Article 368 of the Constitution and therefore void.
2. Whether the Directive Principles of State policy contained in Part IV of the Constitution could have primacy over the fundamental rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution.

Applicable Legal Provisions:
- Article 368 of the Constitution of India
- Sick Textile Undertakings (Nationalisation) Act, 1974
- Constitution (Thirty-Ninth Amendment) Act
- Constitution (Forty Second Amendment) Act

Holding(s):
- The Court held that sections 4 and 55 of the Constitution (Forty Second Amendment) Act were void and beyond the amending power of the Parliament.
- The Court affirmed the importance of the balance between fundamental rights and Directive Principles in the Indian Constitution.

Legal Reasoning/Rationale:
The Court reasoned that sections 4 and 55 of the Constitution (Forty Second Amendment) Act transgressed the limitations on the amending power of Parliament and empowered the Parliament to exercise its constituent power without any limitation. The Court held that no constituent power can go higher than the power conferred by Article 368, and the power to destroy is not a power to amend. The Court further held that the limitations on the amending power of Parliament are one of the basic features of the Indian Constitution and cannot be destroyed. The Court stated that Parliament cannot expand its amending power under Article 368 to repeal or abrogate the Constitution or destroy its basic and essential features. Regarding the primacy of Directive Principles over fundamental rights, the Court held that the balance between Parts III and IV of the Constitution, which contain fundamental rights and Directive Principles respectively, is an essential feature of the basic structure of the Constitution. The Court emphasized the importance of both fundamental rights and Directive Principles in achieving the social revolution envisioned by the Constitution.
