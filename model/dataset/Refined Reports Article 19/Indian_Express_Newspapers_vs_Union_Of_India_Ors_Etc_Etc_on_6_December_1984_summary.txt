The court also noted that newspapers play a crucial role in advancing the public interest by publishing facts and opinions necessary for a democratic electorate to make responsible judgments.

Additional Context:

The additional context provided in the case reveals that the government had previously granted exemptions from the payment of customs duty on newsprint, indicating that the levy was likely to have a serious impact on the newspaper industry. The court acknowledged that while it was not possible to conclusively establish the burden imposed by the levy, there were indications that it could affect the circulation of newspapers and, therefore, the freedom of the press. As a result, the court directed the Central Government to reconsider the matter and determine the extent of exemption that should be granted in light of the impact on the newspaper industry and the freedom of the press.

The court also addressed the argument that the classification of newspapers for the levy of import duty was discriminatory. It rejected this contention, stating that the objective of assisting small and medium newspapers in reducing their production costs was not sinister and had a nexus with the object to be achieved. The court emphasized the duty of the state to encourage education of the masses through the medium of the press and rejected the challenge to the classification.

In terms of relief, the court held that quashing the impugned notifications would not revive the previous notification that granted total exemption from customs duty. Instead, the court directed the government to reconsider the liability of the petitioners and others and recover only a reduced amount of customs duty and auxiliary duty until the matter was redetermined. The court also allowed for the possibility of refunds if it was found that the petitioners were entitled to them.

Overall, this case provides a comprehensive understanding of the legal issues, reasoning, and implications of the court's decision to strike down the imposition of customs duty and auxiliary duty on newsprint. It highlights the importance of protecting the freedom of the press and ensuring that government actions do not unduly burden the newspaper industry or impede the dissemination of information.
