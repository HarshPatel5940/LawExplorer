Author: R Pal 
Bench: Ruma Pal, B.N. Srikrishna.

Headnotes 1: 

Type of Case: Environmental Law

Key Decision: Allows laying of crude oil pipelines through the Jamnagar Marine National Park and Sanctuary subject to conditions. 

Main Issue: Whether laying of crude oil pipelines destroys wildlife habitat under Section 29 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

Party Challenging Decision: Halar Utkarsh Samiti and Jansangharsh Manch (respondent NGOs)

Key Legal Principle: Laying pipelines does not necessarily lead to destruction of wildlife. State can permit it if convinced that damage is minimal and reversible.  

Specific Question of Law: If laying pipelines violates Section 29 prohibition on destroying wildlife habitat in sanctuaries.

Key Evidence: Expert reports showed pipeline damage would be minimal and reversible. No evidence that it would destroy wildlife.

Headnotes 2:

Environmental Law – Wildlife habitat protection – Laying pipelines in sanctuary – Respondent NGOs challenged State permission to appellant company to lay crude oil pipelines through Jamnagar Marine National Park and Sanctuary – Whether laying pipelines violates Section 29 WPA prohibition against destroying wildlife habitat – Held, laying pipelines does not necessarily destroy wildlife habitat – State can permit if damage is minimal and reversible – Expert reports showed no destruction of wildlife by laying pipelines – Appeal allowed subject to conditions.

Legal Proposition: 

The appellant company, Essar Oil Ltd, proposed to lay crude oil pipelines to its oil refinery through the Jamnagar Marine National Park and Sanctuary in Gujarat. The respondent NGOs, Halar Utkarsh Samiti and Jansangharsh Manch, challenged the State permission to lay the pipelines, arguing that it violates Section 29 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. 

Section 29 prohibits destroying wildlife habitat in sanctuaries without permission from the Chief Wildlife Warden. The NGOs argued that laying pipelines will destroy wildlife habitat, violating Section 29. 

The State and appellant argued that Section 29 only prohibits irreversible destruction of habitat. Since reports showed pipeline damage would be minimal and reversible, State can permit it after proper studies.

Case History:

Essar Oil proposed to set up an oil refinery in Jamnagar, Gujarat and sought to lay crude oil pipelines to the refinery through the Jamnagar Marine National Park and Sanctuary. 

The National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) and NEERI submitted reports that pipeline damage would be minimal and reversible if proper precautions were taken.

The State Government granted permission to lay the pipelines under Section 29 of the Wildlife Protection Act, subject to several conditions. 

Halar Utkarsh Samiti and Jansangharsh Manch, two NGOs, filed public interest litigations in the Gujarat High Court challenging the permission.

The High Court ruled that laying pipelines violates Section 29 prohibition on destroying wildlife habitat, since it was not necessary for betterment of wildlife. It set aside the State permission.

Essar Oil appealed to the Supreme Court against the High Court judgment.

Legal Issues:

1. Whether laying pipelines through a sanctuary violates Section 29 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 which prohibits destroying wildlife habitat? 

2. Whether Section 29 prohibits any activity that damages wildlife habitat or only irreversible destruction?

3. Whether State Government can permit laying of pipelines if expert reports conclude damage would be minimal and reversible?

4. Whether reports of expert bodies can be relied upon to arrive at the conclusion that no irreversible destruction of wildlife habitat will be caused?

Applicable Legal Provisions: 

- Section 29 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 - prohibits destroying wildlife habitat in sanctuaries without permission

- Section 18 and Section 26A of WPA - procedure for notifying sanctuary areas 

- Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 - requires Central Government approval for non-forest activity on forest land 

- Environment Protection Act, 1986 - regulates activities in coastal areas through Coastal Regulation Zone notifications

Holdings:

1. Laying of pipelines does not necessarily lead to destruction of wildlife or irreversible damage to habitat. 

2. Section 29 prohibits only irreversible destruction of wildlife habitat that completely and irreversibly damages habitat. Some damage is permitted if reversible. 

3. State can permit laying of pipelines if convinced based on expert studies that damage would be minimal and reversible, and with proper safeguards. 

4. In this case, expert reports showed no irreversible destruction of wildlife habitat. Permission valid subject to conditions.  

Legal Reasoning:

- Stockhom Declaration recognizes need to balance environment protection and development. Complete prohibition on any activity in sanctuary is not the intent. 

- Section 29 prohibits only irreversible destruction of habitat. Some damage is permitted if reversible and with proper safeguards. Sanctuary purpose is not to freeze area but to conserve it.

- Court cannot assess environmental impact but can see if expert bodies were consulted and their recommendations followed. 

- Laying pipelines does not necessarily lead to destruction of wildlife based on international practice, CRZ notifications, and expert reports in this case. 

- NIO and NEERI studies showed only minimal disturbance, not destruction. No evidence showed irreversible damage.

- State Government independently applied mind based on expert studies and gave permission with stringent safeguards. Validates de facto permission already granted earlier.  

Rule of Law/Legal Principle:

- Destruction of wildlife habitat in sanctuaries is prohibited only if irreversible and complete. Some minimal damage is permitted if reversible and with proper safeguards.

- State can permit activities in sanctuary if convinced based on expert studies that only minimal reversible damage would be caused, and with proper safeguards. 

- Expert studies can be relied upon to conclude whether proposed activity will irreversibly destroy wildlife habitat or not.

Concurring and Dissenting Opinions:

None. Unanimous decision allowing the appeal.

Implications and Significance:

- Clarifies that Section 29 WPA does not impose absolute prohibition on activities in protected areas. Some activities can be permitted subject to expert studies.

- Ensures balance between environment protection and development needs by allowing reversible changes with safeguards. 

- Lays down guidelines for granting permission for projects - expert studies, public notice, safeguards, finding of reversibility etc.

- Provides significance to expert reports in determining environmental impact. 

- Reiterates courts cannot assess environmental impact but can ensure expert recommendations are followed.

Comments/Analysis:

This progressive decision balances environment protection and sustainable development. It interprets laws pragmatically, not absolutist manner. Sanctuaries aim to conserve habitat, not freeze areas. Minimal changes are permitted if reversible, similar to doctrine of sustainability. Reliance on expert studies and public notice ensures informed decision making. Insistence on stringent safeguards provides caution against uncontrolled damage in the name of development. The guidelines established will streamline the clearance process while maintaining sanctity of protected areas. Overall, a well-reasoned judgment upholding cooperative federalism and scientific temper.
