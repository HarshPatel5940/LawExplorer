Constitutional Law - Prevention of Begging - Validity of legislation criminalizing begging - Petitioners challenged constitutional validity of sections of Bombay Prevention of Begging Act criminalizing begging - Whether criminalization of begging under Act violates fundamental rights.

Legal Proposition: 

The petitioners, Harsh Mander & Anr., filed writ petitions in the High Court of Delhi challenging the constitutional validity of sections 4, 5, 6 and other provisions of the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959. The Act criminalized begging and gave police powers to arrest and detain beggars. 

The petitioners argued that criminalizing begging targets the poorest sections of society and violates their fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. They contended it manifestly arbitrary, violates right to equality, free speech and the right to life and liberty. 

The State argued that begging needs to be criminalized to determine if it is forced or voluntary and justified detention to ascertain the cause of begging. They stated the Act intends to rehabilitate beggars.

Case History:

- The Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959 was extended to Delhi in 1960. 

- The petitioners filed writ petitions in 2009 and 2015 challenging the constitutional validity of the Act. 

- A single judge of Delhi High Court in Ram Lakhan v. State (2007) had observed that begging may be protected under right to free speech under Article 19(1)(a).

- The petitions were heard by a Division Bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C. Hari Shankar.

Legal Issues/Questions Presented: 

1. Whether the provisions of the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959 criminalizing begging violate the fundamental right to equality under Article 14?

2. Whether criminalizing begging violates the fundamental right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution? 

3. Whether the provisions violate the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a)?

4. Whether the Act imposes reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order, decency or morality?

Applicable Legal Provisions:

- Article 14 of the Constitution of India (Right to Equality)
- Article 19 of the Constitution of India (Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression) 
- Article 21 of the Constitution of India (Right to Life and Liberty)
- Articles 39, 41 and 42 under Directive Principles of State Policy 

Holding(s):

1. Sections 4, 5, 6 and other provisions of Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959 criminalizing begging are unconstitutional as it violates Article 14, 19 and 21.

2. The court struck down Sections 4, 5, 6 and other related provisions criminalizing begging as manifestly arbitrary and violative of Articles 14, 19 and 21. 

3. Begging is a symptom of poverty and criminalizing it deprives the poorest sections of the right to life and dignity. 

4. The State failed to discharge its constitutional obligation to provide every citizen necessity of life. Presence of beggars evidence of State's failure.

5. Criminalizing begging targets vulnerable sections of society; does not distinguish between voluntary and forced begging.

6. Supreme Court has held right to life includes right to food, clothing, shelter, education, healthcare and livelihood. 

7. The Act is manifestly arbitrary as it criminalizes even involuntary begging due to poverty.

Legal Reasoning/Rationale: 

- The statute makes no distinction between voluntary and forced begging. This manifestly arbitrary and violates Article 14.

- Criminalizing begging targets the poorest sections of society who beg due to poverty and deprives them of their fundamental right to life and liberty under Article 21. 

- Begging is protected under right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) subject to reasonable restrictions. Complete criminalization excessive.  

- Article 21 right to life has been interpreted to include right to food, clothing, shelter, education etc. The State failed to discharge its duty under the Constitution.

- Presence of beggars is evidence of failure of the State to provide bare necessities of life to all citizens. Criminalizing them violates their dignity. 

- Forced begging can be addressed by specific legislation based on empirical examination. Complete criminalization disproportionate.

Rule of Law/Legal Principle Established:

- Complete criminalization of begging violates fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19 and 21. 

- State has a duty under Constitution to provide bare necessities of life essential for right to live with dignity. 

- Article 21 right to life includes right to food, shelter, clothing, education, livelihood etc. 

- Under the Constitution, State must ensure justice, liberty, equality and dignity to all citizens. 

Concurring and Dissenting Opinions:

None. Unanimous decision by the Division Bench.

Implications and Significance: 

- Striking down the law de-criminalizes begging and prevents arbitrary detention of the homeless and poor. 

- Expands scope of right to life under Article 21 based on previous Supreme Court decisions.

- Places greater responsibility on State to secure socio-economic rights and provide social security.

- More targeted legislation needed to address forced begging. Focus should be on rehabilitation not criminalization.

- Judgment affirms commitment to safeguarding dignity of the marginalized and upholds constitutional values of justice, equality and fraternity. 

Comments/Analysis:

- The decision is significant as it advances the constitutional transformation of Article 21 into an umbrella right encompassing various socio-economic entitlements essential for right to life and human dignity. 

- It reaffirms the State's commitment to securing social justice for vulnerable sections as mandated by the Constitution's preamble and directive principles.

- The Court adopted an expansive interpretation of right to life, favoring protection of dignity and socio-economic rights of the marginalized.

- The ruling is socially progressive but the State needs a roadmap to rehabilitate beggars and address the root causes of poverty and destitution. Merely de-criminalizing begging without providing alternatives is insufficient.

- The Court reaffirmed the transformative vision of the Constitution as a tool for empowerment of the marginalized and underprivileged sections.
