Taxation Law – Service tax exemption – Withdrawal – Petitioners challenged withdrawal of exemption from service tax for construction services provided to government – Whether government has power to withdraw exemption earlier granted and levy service tax.

Legal Proposition: 

The petitioners, who were contractors engaged by the Public Works Department of the State and Central Government for construction of buildings like schools, were earlier exempted from payment of service tax under Mega Exemption Notification No. 25/2012 dated 20.06.2012. This exemption was withdrawn by Notification No. 6/2015-Service Tax dated 01.03.2015, making their services taxable. The petitioners have challenged this withdrawal of exemption.

Case History:

- The petitioners were engaged as contractors by the Public Works Department of the State and Central Government for construction of school buildings and other structures. 

- They were exempted from payment of service tax under Mega Exemption Notification No. 25/2012 dated 20.06.2012. 

- This exemption was withdrawn by Notification No. 6/2015-Service Tax dated 01.03.2015 issued by the Central Government.

- Consequently, the services provided by the petitioners became taxable under the provisions of the Finance Act, 1994 from 01.04.2015. 

- The petitioners were issued show cause notices and demands for payment of service tax. 

- The petitioners have challenged Notification No. 6/2015 withdrawing the exemption and the consequential show cause notices and demands before the Madras High Court.

- Several similar writ petitions were clubbed together and heard by a Division Bench of the High Court.

Legal Issues/Questions Presented: 

1. Whether the Central Government has the power to withdraw the exemption from service tax granted earlier?

2. Whether the withdrawal of exemption violates the rights of the petitioners under Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution of India? 

3. Whether the demand of service tax from the petitioners is valid?

Applicable Legal Provisions:

- Article 14 of the Constitution of India (Right to Equality)
- Article 19 of the Constitution of India (Right to Freedom) 
- Sections 66B, 93 of the Finance Act, 1994
- Mega Exemption Notification No. 25/2012 dated 20.06.2012 
- Notification No. 6/2015-Service Tax dated 01.03.2015

Holding:

1. The Central Government has the power to grant exemption from payment of service tax in public interest under Section 93 of the Finance Act, 1994. This power also implies the power to withdraw the exemption in public interest. 

2. The withdrawal of exemption granted earlier is a matter of policy and the Court cannot sit in appeal over it unless it is shown to be arbitrary or mala fide. 

3. There is no violation of Articles 14 or 19 as a result of the withdrawal of exemption.

4. Consequently, the demand of service tax made on the petitioners after withdrawal of exemption is valid. 

5. The writ petitions challenging Notification No. 6/2015 withdrawing the exemption are dismissed.  

Legal Reasoning/Rationale:

- The power to grant exemption under Section 93 of the Finance Act, 1994 also implies the power to withdraw the exemption. This has been upheld by the Supreme Court.

- The earlier exemption was granted in public interest. The withdrawal of exemption is also a decision taken in public interest as the Government has to broaden the tax base. 

- The Court cannot sit in appeal over the decision of the Government regarding public interest unless it is shown to be arbitrary or mala fide. 

- No material has been shown that the decision to withdraw exemption was arbitrary or improper. 

- The petitioners were always offering taxable services. The exemption granted was temporary and could be withdrawn. 

- Merely because some petitioners are illiterate cannot be a ground for exemption. Also, the petitioners were already registered under VAT and Income Tax.

- There is a presumption that the Government acts in public interest. There is no requirement for the Government to justify public interest in each case.

- The petitioners can claim reimbursement from service recipients based on principles applicable. Hence, they are not remediless.

Rule of Law/Legal Principle Established or Applied:

1. The executive has wide discretion in matters relating to granting or withdrawal of exemptions from taxation, subject only to limited judicial review on grounds of arbitrariness or mala fides. 

2. Exemptions from taxation are by way of exceptions and are susceptible to being withdrawn in public interest. Taxpayers do not have an enforceable right to continuance of exemptions. 

3. Courts cannot sit in appeal over wisdom of economic policies relating to taxation. Judicial review is limited to only arbitrariness or violation of fundamental rights.

Concurring and Dissenting Opinions:

This was a unanimous decision by the Division Bench. There were no dissenting opinions. 

Implications and Significance:

- Upholds wide discretion of the executive in matters of taxation policy and granting exemptions. Insulates executive decisions from routine judicial review.

- Tax exemptions can be withdrawn in public interest subject to limited judicial review. Secures flexibility for the Government in designing taxation policies. 

- Taxpayers should be aware that exemptions can be withdrawn at a future date and should not assume them to be permanent concessions.

- Government should periodically review exemptions and weigh public interest in continuing or withdrawing them. An exemption continued for long may come to be assumed as a right.

Comments/Analysis: 

- The decision reiterates the established legal position on limited grounds for judicial review of executive decisions in economic matters like taxation. It rightly refrains from undertaking merits review of withdrawal of exemption.

- However, the Government should ensure that decisions like withdrawal of exemptions are taken in a transparent manner with adequate stakeholder consultation. Sudden withdrawals should be avoided. 

- The decision shows the uncertainty associated with exemptions in a dynamic taxation system. It highlights the need for stability and continuity in taxation policies. Frequent withdrawals dilute taxpayer confidence. 

- The Government may consider including 'sunset' clauses in exemptions stipulating fixed timeframes, thus lending greater certainty. Periodic reviews before expiry can evaluate continuation or otherwise.

In conclusion, this decision applies settled legal principles on judicial review of executive decisions in taxation matters. It upholds the Government's power to withdraw exemptions in public interest subject to limited judicial scrutiny. While securing policy flexibility for the executive, it highlights the need for transparent and gradual changes in taxation policies.
