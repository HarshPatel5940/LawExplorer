Legal Proposition: 
The appellants, who were general category candidates, challenged the promotion of the respondents, who were SC/ST candidates, to higher posts in the UP Public Works Department (PWD) under the reservation policy. The appellants contended that reservation in promotions under Articles 16(4) and 16(4A) violates the fundamental right to equality under Articles 14 and 16(1). 

Case History:
- UP government issued reservation rules in 1990 providing for reservation in promotion for SCs/STs in state services. 
- Between 1981-1994, respondents (SC/ST candidates) were promoted to higher posts in UP PWD under this reservation policy. 
- Appellants (general category candidates) challenged these promotions in Allahabad HC in 1993, contending promotion reservation was unconstitutional. 
- Allahabad HC dismissed petition in 1993, upholding validity of promotion reservation.  
- Appellants appealed to Supreme Court against High Court judgment.

Legal Issues/Questions Presented: 
1. Whether reservation in promotions under Articles 16(4) and 16(4A) violates fundamental right to equality under Articles 14 and 16(1)?
2. Whether promotion of reserved category candidates under reservation policy is constitutionally valid?

Applicable Legal Provisions:
- Articles 14, 16(1), 16(4), 16(4A) - Right to equality, Reservation in promotions 
- Articles 17, 46, 335 - Abolition of untouchability, promotion of weaker sections, claims of SCs/STs

Holding(s):

Legal Reasoning/Rationale:

- To provide equality in fact, reservation in promotions is required if SCs/STs are inadequately represented.
- No evidence that reservation in promotions affects efficiency of administration under Article 335.
- Parliament validated reservation in promotions by inserting Article 16(4A) in light of Supreme Court decision in Indira Sawhney case.
