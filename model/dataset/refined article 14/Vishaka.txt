Holding:

Concurring and Dissenting Opinions: None. Unanimous decision. 

Implications and Significance:

- The Vishaka guidelines became the only law to deal with workplace sexual harassment complaints in India for years, until enactment of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act in 2013.

- Under the guidelines, employers in public and private sectors were obligated to ensure protection of women from sexual harassment. 

- The case is seen as an example of judicial activism wherein the Court laid down progressive legal principles and innovative remedies in response to public interest litigation.

Comments/Analysis: 

- The Vishaka guidelines had far reaching impact and were a pioneering step in raising awareness on workplace harassment. The case is globally cited for its articulation of links between sexual harassment, discrimination and violation of constitutional rights.

- However, there were criticisms that the guidelines tilted heavily in favour of women without adequate safeguards for accused. The case also led to debates on limits of judicial law making in sensitive socio-legal issues in the domain of legislation.

In conclusion, this case will go down in history as triggering the evolution of both judicial and legislative framework around workplace sexual harassment in India. The guidelines formulated continue to supplement the law enacted in 2013.
