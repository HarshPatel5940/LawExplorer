The review petitions filed by the supporters of the traditional ban on the entry of women aged 10-50 years into the Sabarimala temple argued that the exclusion of women is an essential religious practice and does not amount to discrimination. However, the Court found that these arguments were already made earlier and did not provide sufficient grounds for review. Mere re-arguments cannot justify a review.\n\n2. The Court recognized that the case involved significant constitutional questions on the interplay between religious freedom under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution and other fundamental rights. It also highlighted the apparent conflict between the Shirur Mutt (1954) and Durgah Committee (1962) cases on the role of the Court in determining essential religious practices.\n\n3. Considering the importance of the issues involved, the Court referred the case to a larger bench of 7 or more judges for reconsideration. This decision was made to ensure an authoritative determination of the constitutional validity of the traditional ban on the entry of women into the Sabarimala temple.\n\n4. The Court emphasized that constitutional issues should be settled by larger benches of 5 or more judges to provide clarity and consistency in the interpretation of the law. By referring the case to a larger bench, the Court aimed to address the complex issues raised and provide an authoritative decision.\n\nOverall, the legal reasoning behind the judgment in this case reflects the Court's recognition of the need for a comprehensive reconsideration of the constitutional questions involved. The Court's decision to refer the case to a larger bench demonstrates its commitment to ensuring an authoritative determination and maintaining the balance between religious freedom and fundamental rights."}

Firstly, the majority decision of the 5-judge Constitution bench failed to consider the long-standing religious traditions and practices associated with the Sabarimala temple. The ban on entry of women aged 10-50 years is an essential religious practice that has been followed for centuries and is deeply rooted in the beliefs and customs of the devotees. The Court should have given more weight to the religious sentiments and autonomy of the temple management in determining the validity of the ban.\n\nSecondly, the Court's interpretation of Articles 25(1) and 26 of the Constitution is flawed. The majority held that the ban on women's entry into the temple violated their right to worship under Article 25(1). However, this interpretation fails to consider that the right to worship is not absolute and can be subject to reasonable restrictions. The ban on women of a certain age group is a reasonable restriction based on the unique nature of the temple and the associated rituals.\n\nFurthermore, the Court's decision to refer the case to a larger bench for reconsideration is also questionable. The original 5-judge bench had already examined the issues in detail and arrived at a majority decision. There is no need for a larger bench to re-examine the same issues, as it would only lead to further delay and uncertainty.\n\nLastly, the Court's decision fails to give due regard to the principle of judicial restraint. The judiciary should exercise caution in interfering with religious practices and traditions, especially when they have been followed for centuries without any constitutional challenge. The Court should have respected the principle of non-interference in matters of religious belief and allowed the temple management to continue with their age-old practices.\n\nIn light of these grounds, it is imperative to appeal the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Kantaru Rajeevaru vs Indian Young Lawyers Association. The decision undermines the religious autonomy of the temple management and sets a dangerous precedent for interference in religious matters. It is essential to protect the rights of religious institutions and ensure that their practices are not unduly interfered with by the judiciary."}

These errors should be clearly pointed out and supported by legal arguments and authorities.\n\n3. Engage experienced counsel: It is crucial to engage experienced and skilled counsel who specialize in constitutional law and have a strong track record in appellate litigation. The counsel should be well-versed in the specific legal issues involved in the case and capable of presenting a compelling argument before the higher court.\n\n4.

My dissenting opinion is as follows:\n\nI believe that the majority has erred in its interpretation of the constitutional rights of Hindu women under Articles 25(1) and 26. The majority has held that the ban on women's entry into the Sabarimala temple is discriminatory and violates their fundamental right to worship. However, I disagree with this interpretation.\n\nFirstly, it is important to recognize that the Sabarimala temple is a religious institution with its own set of customs and traditions. These customs have been followed for centuries and are deeply rooted in the beliefs and practices of the devotees. The ban on women aged 10-50 years is an essential religious practice that has been followed without interruption for a long time. It is not based on any form of discrimination but rather on the unique nature of the deity and the rituals performed at the temple.\n\nSecondly, the majority has failed to consider the religious sentiments and beliefs of the devotees. The Sabarimala temple is dedicated to Lord Ayyappa, who is believed to be a celibate deity. The ban on women of menstruating age is based on the belief that the presence of women of this age group would disturb the celibate nature of the deity and the purity of the temple. This belief is deeply ingrained in the minds of the devotees and is an integral part of their religious faith.\n\nThirdly, it is important to note that the Constitution of India guarantees the right to freedom of religion under Article 25(1). This includes the right of religious denominations to manage their own affairs in matters of religion under Article 26. The ban on women's entry into the Sabarimala temple is a matter of religious practice and falls within the purview of the temple's management. It is not for the court to interfere with the religious practices of a particular denomination unless they are manifestly arbitrary or violative of the basic tenets of the religion.\n\nIn conclusion, I dissent from the majority opinion and would uphold the traditional ban on the entry of women aged 10-50 years into the Sabarimala temple. I believe that the ban is an essential religious practice that is protected by the right to freedom of religion under the Constitution. It is not discriminatory but rather based on the unique nature of the deity and the religious beliefs of the devotees. The court should respect the religious practices of the temple and refrain from interfering unless they are manifestly arbitrary or violative of the basic tenets of the religion."}

These responses aim to address the issues surrounding the ban on the entry of women aged 10-50 years into the Sabarimala temple.   1. Enactment of a specific legislation: The legislature can consider enacting a specific law that either upholds or overturns the ban on the entry of women into the Sabarimala temple. This legislation can provide clear guidelines and regulations regarding the entry of women into religious places, taking into account the principles of equality, non-discrimination, and religious freedom.  2. Amendment of existing laws: The legislature can also consider amending existing laws, such as the Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Rules, 1965, which currently bans the entry of women aged 10-50 years into the Sabarimala temple. The amendment can either remove the ban altogether or impose certain conditions or restrictions on the entry of women, while ensuring that their fundamental rights are not violated.  3. Establishment of a regulatory body: The legislature can establish a regulatory body or authority to oversee and regulate the entry of women into religious places. This body can be responsible for formulating guidelines, monitoring compliance, and addressing any disputes or grievances related to the entry of women into temples like Sabarimala. The regulatory body can ensure that the rights of women and religious practices are balanced and protected.  4. Promotion of dialogue and awareness: The legislature can play a role in promoting dialogue and awareness among various stakeholders, including religious institutions, women's rights organizations, and the general public. This can be done through public campaigns, educational programs, and community engagement initiatives. The aim would be to foster understanding, respect, and acceptance of diverse viewpoints while upholding constitutional values.  5. Review and reform of religious practices: The legislature can initiate a comprehensive review and reform of religious practices that may be discriminatory or violative of fundamental rights. This can involve engaging with religious leaders, scholars, and experts to identify practices that need to be reformed or abolished to ensure gender equality and non-discrimination.  It is important to note that any legislative response should be carefully crafted to strike a balance between religious freedom and individual rights.

This ban is discriminatory and infringes upon the right to freedom of religion guaranteed under Article 25(1). It restricts the ability of Hindu women to freely practice and propagate their religion by denying them access to a place of worship solely based on their gender and age.\n\nSecondly, the law also raises concerns regarding the right of religious denominations to manage their own affairs under Article 26. While religious denominations have the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, this right is not absolute and must be subject to reasonable restrictions. The ban on entry of women aged 10-50 years can be argued to be an unreasonable restriction that infringes upon the rights of Hindu women to manage their religious affairs and participate in religious practices.\n\nFurthermore, the law fails to uphold the principles of gender equality and non-discrimination enshrined in the Constitution. It perpetuates patriarchal norms and stereotypes by treating women as impure or unfit for worship during their reproductive years. This violates the principles of equality and dignity guaranteed under Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.\n\nIn conclusion, the law applied in the case of Kantaru Rajeevaru vs Indian Young Lawyers Association & Ors. can be challenged on the grounds of violating the fundamental rights of Hindu women under Articles 25(1) and 26, as well as the principles of gender equality and non-discrimination. It is imperative that the court reconsiders the constitutionality of this law and ensures that the rights of Hindu women are protected and upheld."}

Human Rights: The case involves the question of whether the ban on the entry of women aged 10-50 into the Sabarimala temple violates their rights under Articles 25(1) and 26 of the Indian Constitution. These articles guarantee the freedom of religion and the right to manage religious affairs.

The Court may consider relevant international human rights standards and jurisprudence to interpret and apply these constitutional provisions.\n\n2. Non-Discrimination: The issue of gender-based discrimination arises in this case, as the ban on women's entry into the Sabarimala temple is based on their age and biological characteristics.

The Supreme Court's decision to refer the case to a larger 7-judge bench for reconsideration has significant implications for the temple and its management.\n\nFirstly, the decision has sparked debates and discussions on the balance between religious practices and gender equality. It has brought attention to the issue of gender discrimination in religious places and has led to a broader conversation about women's rights in India. This may result in increased scrutiny of other religious institutions and practices that discriminate against women.\n\nSecondly, the decision has a direct impact on the Sabarimala temple and its management. The temple attracts millions of devotees every year, and the ban on the entry of women aged 10-50 years has been a long-standing tradition. If the larger bench upholds the original judgment and allows women of all ages to enter the temple, it could lead to significant changes in the temple's operations, infrastructure, and crowd management. The temple authorities may need to implement measures to ensure the safety and comfort of women devotees, such as separate facilities and crowd control mechanisms.\n\nThirdly, the decision may have implications for the tourism industry in Kerala. Sabarimala is a major pilgrimage site and a significant tourist attraction. If the ban on women's entry is lifted, it could lead to an increase in the number of visitors, both domestic and international, who wish to experience the temple's religious and cultural significance. This, in turn, could boost the local economy, create employment opportunities, and drive tourism-related businesses.\n\nOverall, the decision in the Kantaru Rajeevaru case has far-reaching implications for the religious, tourism, and gender equality sectors in India.

In this case, if a group of men challenges the ban, arguing that it violates their fundamental right to worship under Article 25(1) of the Constitution, the principles established in the Kantaru Rajeevaru case can be applied.   The court's decision in the Kantaru Rajeevaru case emphasized the need for a larger bench to reconsider issues related to women's entry into the Sabarimala temple. Similarly, in the hypothetical scenario, the court may refer the case to a larger bench to determine the constitutional validity of the ban on men aged 60 and above. The court would examine whether the ban violates the rights of the men under Article 25(1) and whether the temple can claim protection as a religious denomination under Article 26.  The court's reasoning in the Kantaru Rajeevaru case, which highlighted the significance of constitutional questions and the interplay between religious freedom and fundamental rights, would also be relevant in the hypothetical scenario. The court would consider the arguments put forth by the men challenging the ban, as well as any arguments presented by the religious institution in defense of the ban.  Overall, the Kantaru Rajeevaru case provides a framework for analyzing and evaluating the constitutional validity of religious practices that impose restrictions on certain groups of individuals. It establishes the importance of considering fundamental rights, constitutional morality, and the need for authoritative determination by larger benches in cases involving such practices. Applying these principles to the hypothetical fact pattern would help guide the court's decision-making process and ensure a fair and just outcome."}

The case revolves around the ban on the entry of women aged 10-50 years into the Sabarimala temple, which is a religious practice followed by the temple authorities. The Supreme Court's decision to refer the case to a larger bench for reconsideration raises important questions about the balance between religious practices and individual rights, particularly in the context of minority communities.\n\nThe case highlights the need to strike a balance between the rights of religious denominations to manage their own affairs under Article 26 of the Constitution and the fundamental rights of individuals, including the right to equality and freedom of religion under Articles 14, 15, 25, and 26. The larger bench's decision will have far-reaching implications for minority rights, as it will provide clarity on the scope and limitations of religious practices that may infringe upon individual rights.\n\nIf the larger bench upholds the ban on the entry of women into the Sabarimala temple, it may set a precedent that could potentially impact the rights of other minority communities. It may raise questions about the extent to which religious practices can limit the rights of individuals belonging to minority groups. On the other hand, if the larger bench strikes down the ban, it would reinforce the principle of equality and non-discrimination, thereby strengthening the protection of minority rights.\n\nFurthermore, the case also raises broader questions about the interpretation and application of Article 25(1) of the Constitution, which guarantees the freedom of religion. The decision of the larger bench will provide guidance on how to reconcile the rights of individuals to practice their religion with the need to prevent discrimination and ensure gender equality.\n\nIn conclusion, the Kantaru Rajeevaru case has the potential to significantly impact minority rights in India.

In the digital age, this balance becomes crucial when considering issues such as hate speech, incitement to violence, or dissemination of offensive content online. The principles established in this case can guide the courts in determining the limits of religious freedom in the digital realm and ensuring that it does not infringe upon the rights of others.\n\nAdditionally, the case emphasizes the need for a larger bench to reconsider significant constitutional questions.

Although the case primarily deals with the issue of women's entry into the Sabarimala temple, it raises broader questions about the balance between religious practices and constitutional rights. These broader questions can have implications for environmental law in India.\n\nOne potential implication is the recognition of the importance of constitutional morality in determining the validity of religious practices. The Court's reference to the concept of constitutional morality suggests that religious practices cannot be immune from constitutional scrutiny, even if they have a long-standing tradition. This recognition can have implications for environmental law by emphasizing the need to balance religious practices with environmental protection. It can lead to a more nuanced approach in cases where religious practices may have adverse environmental impacts.\n\nFurthermore, the case highlights the significance of larger benches in authoritatively determining substantial constitutional questions. This recognition can also be relevant in environmental law cases where complex legal and constitutional issues arise. It emphasizes the importance of having a comprehensive and authoritative understanding of environmental rights and obligations.\n\nAdditionally, the case raises questions about the interpretation and application of Article 25(1) of the Constitution, which guarantees the freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practice, and propagate religion. The Court's examination of the interplay between religious freedom and other fundamental rights can have implications for environmental law cases where conflicts arise between religious practices and environmental protection measures. It can provide guidance on how to strike a balance between these competing interests.\n\nOverall, the case Kantaru Rajeevaru vs Indian Young Lawyers Association has the potential to influence Indian environmental law by emphasizing the importance of constitutional morality, the role of larger benches in determining constitutional questions, and the need to balance religious practices with environmental protection measures."}

The case primarily focused on the validity of the traditional ban on the entry of women aged 10-50 years into the Sabarimala temple. However, it is important to note that alternative dispute resolution mechanisms can be utilized in various stages of a legal dispute, including before or during court proceedings.\n\nAlternative dispute resolution (ADR) refers to methods of resolving disputes outside of traditional court litigation. These mechanisms aim to provide parties with a more efficient, cost-effective, and collaborative approach to resolving their conflicts. Some common forms of ADR include negotiation, mediation, and arbitration.\n\nIn the context of the provided case, if the parties involved had chosen to explore ADR options, they could have potentially engaged in mediation or negotiation to find a mutually acceptable solution. Mediation, for example, involves a neutral third party facilitating discussions between the parties to help them reach a settlement. This could have allowed the stakeholders to have a dialogue and potentially find a middle ground regarding the entry of women into the Sabarimala temple.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that ADR mechanisms are voluntary, and both parties must agree to participate. In this case, since the focus was on the constitutional validity of the ban, the parties may have chosen to pursue a judicial resolution rather than opting for ADR.\n\nOverall, while alternative dispute resolution mechanisms were not directly utilized in the Kantaru Rajeevaru case, they could have potentially provided an avenue for dialogue and negotiation between the parties involved, leading to a resolution outside of the court system."}

The Court reasoned that the ban was discriminatory and denied women the fundamental right to worship. It emphasized that the right to worship is not limited to men and that women have an equal right to access places of worship.\n\nThe Court's interpretation of Article 25(1) in this case expanded the scope of religious freedom to include the right of women to enter and worship in temples.

On one hand, the individual rights of Hindu women to worship and access religious places, as guaranteed under Articles 25(1) and 26 of the Constitution, are at stake. The Supreme Court's original judgment in September 2018 recognized the discriminatory nature of the traditional ban on the entry of women aged 10-50 years into the Sabarimala temple. It upheld the individual rights of women to equality and freedom of religion, emphasizing that religious practices cannot be used to perpetuate gender discrimination. This decision prioritized the individual rights of women and their right to access religious spaces without any gender-based restrictions.   On the other hand, societal interests are also significant in this case. The traditional ban on women's entry into the Sabarimala temple is based on religious beliefs and practices followed by a significant section of society. It is argued that the ban is an essential religious practice and should be protected under Article 25(1) and Article 26 of the Constitution. Supporters of the ban argue that it is necessary to preserve the sanctity and purity of the temple, as well as to maintain the religious traditions and customs associated with it. They contend that allowing women of reproductive age to enter the temple would disrupt the religious practices and beliefs followed by the devotees.  The Supreme Court, in referring the case to a larger bench, recognized the need to strike a balance between individual rights and societal interests. By referring the case to a larger bench, the Court aims to reconsider the issues involved and provide an authoritative determination. This indicates the Court's recognition of the complex nature of the case and the need to carefully weigh the individual rights of women against the religious beliefs and practices of the society.  The balance between individual rights and societal interests is a delicate matter in this case. The Court's decision will have far-reaching implications for both women's rights and religious practices. It will shape the understanding of constitutional rights and the extent to which religious practices can be regulated in order to ensure gender equality.
