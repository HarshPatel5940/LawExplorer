The Court was asked to determine whether transgender persons are entitled to rights under Articles 14, 15, 16 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India.

Case History:
- The writ petitions were directly filed in the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution.

   - Right to life and personal liberty under Article 21

Applicable Legal Provisions:
- Articles 14, 15, 16, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India (dealing with fundamental rights)
- Article 32 of the Constitution (right to move Supreme Court for enforcement of fundamental rights)

Holding(s):
1. Transgender persons are entitled to rights under Articles 14, 15, 16, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. Non-recognition of transgender identity violates fundamental constitutional rights.

2. Transgender persons have a right to decide their self-identified gender. Government must legally recognise their gender identity. 

3. Transgender persons must be recognised as a third gender apart from male and female. They must be treated as socially and educationally backward classes.

Legal Reasoning/Rationale: 
- Gender identity lies at the core of one's personal identity and denying transgender identity violates personal autonomy under Article 21. 

- Non-recognition of transgender identity denies them equal protection of laws under Article 14.

- Transgender persons face discrimination in access to public places, health care, employment, etc. which violates Articles 15 and 16.

- Expression of transgender identity through dress, speech, etc. is protected under Article 19(1)(a).

- International conventions recognise rights of transgender persons based on gender identity. Constitutional provisions must be interpreted to protect human rights of transgender persons.

Rule of Law/Legal Principle Established or Applied:
- Self-identified gender identity is an integral part of personal autonomy, dignity and freedom under Article 21. 

- Non-recognition of self-identified gender identity violates fundamental right to equality under Article 14.

- Transgender persons are entitled to all fundamental rights under Part III of the Constitution.

Concurring and Dissenting Opinions:
None. Unanimous decision by both judges.

Implications and Significance: 
- Landmark decision upholding transgender rights under the Constitution. 

- Requires government to recognise self-identified gender and provide reservations in education and jobs.

- Prohibits discrimination against transgender persons.

- Basis for enacting legislation and policies for transgender welfare.  

Comments or Analysis: 
The judgment is significant for expanding the scope of fundamental rights and bringing transgender persons within their protection. By recognising self-identified gender identity, it upholds rights of personal autonomy and dignity. The directions for reservations will promote social inclusion. However, effective implementation will require changes in laws and administrative procedures. The Court could have elaborated more on the content and scope of the newly recognised rights. Overall, a progressive judgment protecting the rights of a vulnerable community.
